	Why Moonshine?

	- Works with feature parity on the cloud model

	The first IDE developed to provide cloud support for ActionScript 3 , Apache Flex®, Apache Royale® and Feathers. Now you can create your projects on the cloud and utilize the agility of a cloud based platform using Moonshine IDE.

	- 100% Cross Platform

	Moonshine is a cross platform open source application. With Moonshine you will find the luxury of developing anywhere on any platform.

	- Built specifically to focus on Apache Flex® and Royale®

	The Apache Royale® is a continuation of the previous effort called FlexJS to produce a next-generation of the Apache Flex® SDK that enables developers to use MXML and ActionScript to generate HTML/JS/CSS applications which can run natively in browsers. The cross-compiled code can also be used in Apache Cordova® (Adobe PhoneGap) mobile applications.

	- Subversion support

	We are providing SLIKSVN for subversion support because they provide a standalone command-line Subversion client for Windows. The installer contains all command line tools (svn, svnadmin, svnsync, svnserve, svnmucc) without application bindings or Apache modules. For more information please visit https://sliksvn.com/

	+ Ant build

	+ FDB debugger for debugging support

	+ TourDeFlex component to assist with teaching the Flex syntax

	+ Mobile application development support
